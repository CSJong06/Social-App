## Technical Implementation

### Wireframes & System Architecture

The application follows a modern Next.js architecture with the following key components:
- App Router for page routing and API endpoints
- MongoDB for data persistence
- NextAuth.js for authentication
- Client-side components for interactive features
- Server-side components for data fetching and rendering

### Database Schema

The application uses MongoDB with Mongoose for data modeling. Key collections include:
- Users (authentication and profile data)
- Projects (social media campaign organization)
- Analytics (platform-specific metrics and data)

### AI Model Details

**Model(s) Used:** \[Specify the AI models or APIs used\]  
**Purpose:** \[Explain what the AI model is doing specifically\]  
**Integration Method:** \[Describe how the AI is integrated \- API calls, local model, etc.\]  
**Model Performance Metrics:** \[Include relevant metrics if available\]

### Key Components and Code Snippets

#### Component 1: Authentication System

Secure user authentication using NextAuth.js with JWT tokens and bcrypt password hashing.

#### Component 2: Social Media Integration

Platform-specific integrations for Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube analytics tracking.

#### Component 3: Dashboard

Interactive dashboard with Chart.js visualizations for performance metrics.

### Authentication and Authorization

The application uses NextAuth.js for authentication with JWT tokens. User sessions are managed securely with proper encryption and token handling.

### API Routes

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Authentication Required |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| /api/auth/* | Various | Authentication endpoints | No |
| /api/profile | GET/PUT | User profile management | Yes |
| /api/projects | GET/POST | Project management | Yes |
| /api/analytics/* | GET | Platform-specific analytics | Yes |
